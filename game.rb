      You begin climibing again, but much slower this time due to the worsening of your ankle.  This time you make it, back to the top.  You roll over in exhaustion, trying to catch your breath.  It's nearly dark now, and freezing cold.  And too late for you to save yourself from the brutal, nighttime wilderness. üåô "

      You struggle to make it back over to the small cave, but you are very weak from the fall.  You climb in and fall asleep.  Hypothermia set in at some point during the night, and now no one will find your popsicle body. ‚õÑÔ∏è "

      On your hands and knees you slowly work your way through the brush, but your broken ankle drastically slows your progress. Darkness falls, as does the temperature.  The outlook is grim now, but you keep pressing on.  You know that if you don't keep going you will die of hypothermia.  You struggle through the night, fighting the pain, gradually moving slower and slower.  Through your hard efforts you remained distracted, and didn't notice the pack of wolves slowly encircling you.  You felt a tight clamp around your throat--sharp teeth, your wet blood dripping down, your vision slowly fading to black... üê∫ üê∫ üê∫  "

      Whatever the sound outside was, it wasn't a bear, and that's all you cared about.  You peek your head out and look around but don't see much.  You hobble towards the sound and see something orange through the trees.  You call out, and the hunter responds.  You have found your rescue! üë®‚Äçüåæ

      Not wanting to draw attetion to yourself you remain silent and hidden.  The noise passes and you go out to look around.  It's dark now, and hard to see.  The only thing you hear are your own feet moving through the forest floor.  You turn back to return to the cave when a loud bang bursts through the night sky.  You feel down at the hole now open in your chest, and the blood dripping from it.  The hunter you tried to hide from found you, and in the dark you look a lot like an animal. üî´ "

      Your mind is probably playing tricks with you at this point. Best thing now is to ignore it and get some rest.

      The next morning you awake and crawl outside to daylight.  Your ankle is much better so you continue into the woods.  After half a day of traveling through the forest you begin to hear loud machinery in the distance.  As you near the sounds you discover a lumber camp with men and machines cutting and stripping trees.  They were very surprised to see you."

      Your ankle is done for.  The pain is too great and you have to settle in for the night.  You begin to look for any materials nearby, but all you can find is some wet wood.  You grab what you can, but your movement is limited.   You soon give up on shelter or fire, and look for food.  You find a blackberry bush and start stuffing yourself.
        After the first few tasty berries you realize they aren't blackberries.  You've never had them before but they seem ok.  Until the searing pain in your stomach, the vomiting, and the slow death. ‚ò£ ü§¢ ‚ò£ "

      That small cave is really starting to seem inviting, epecially as the sun is going down.  You turn around to backrack your steps, but before long it is comletely dark.  You don't know where you are anymore, and it's freezing.  It's hard to tell where you are going, but you keep moving.  You eventually become to cold and too tired to move.  And then to breathe. To live. ‚ùÑÔ∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ùÑÔ∏è
